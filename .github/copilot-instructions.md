# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## General Guidelines

- **No summary documents** unless explicitly asked by the user
- Focus on code implementation and task completion
- Provide concise explanations when necessary
- Use tools appropriately to complete requests
- **Use `pytest.mark.parametrize` where possible**: Consolidate repetitive test methods that test the same logic with different inputs into a single parametrized test to reduce code duplication
