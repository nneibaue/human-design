    "description": "Gate 60 represents the drive to realistically accept limitations and to preserve what exists. At the same time it is the basis on which mutations can develop. Yet, it is not about continuous improvement, but about the sudden impulse for basic innovation. Such mutations cannot be influenced deliberately. They just happen \u2013 or they don't. Gate 60 is the root and the point of origin of the pulse-like individual energy that shapes the entire \"Knowing Circuit\". And this is what also makes this gate the source of melancholy, which arises when nothing happens. This melancholy is a person\u2019s creative force. For even when nothing seems to happen, a great deal happens in fact. Or in the words of Miles Davis: \"The music is in the space between the notes.\" The gate's potential is Realism.",
